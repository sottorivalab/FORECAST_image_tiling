# FORECAST Whole Slide Image Tiling Pipeline

This repository contains the code used to convert CZI format slide images into a tiled JPEG format. This converts images into a format suitable for use with other image analysis pipelines, such as the Gleason Segmentation or Cell Classification pipelines used in FORECAST.

Included are scripts for tiling CZI format Whole Slide Images, producing tiled Tissue Segmentation masks, and Stain Normalising tiles.
