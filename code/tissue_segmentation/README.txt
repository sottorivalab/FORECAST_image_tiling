Tissue Segmentation

Scripts for segmenting tissue from background for whole slide histology image data. It is recommended that these scripts are used in conjunction with images in CWS tile format (see image_tiles for more info).

Two methods of segmentation are included, one using an intensity-based thresholding (method 'T') and another using entropy filtering (method 'E'). 

Code requires MATLAB R2019a or later and the Image Processing Toolbox installed. Parallel Computing Toolbox is also recommended.

See demo.m for details on usage.
