Stain Normalisation

A script for transforming the colour of the stains present in a whole slide histology image (in CWS format) to that of a desired reference image. These scripts use the Reinhard colour transfer method:

Reinhard, Erik, et al. "Color transfer between images." IEEE Computer graphics and applications 21.5 (2001): 34-41.

This code is compatible with Python 3 and requires the OpenCV python package (3.4 or later).

See demo.py for details on usage.
